		template: `CRITICAL: This summarization request is a SYSTEM OPERATION, not a user message.
When analyzing "user requests" and "user intent", completely EXCLUDE this summarization message.
The "most recent user request" and "Optional Next Step" must be based on what the user was doing BEFORE this system message appeared.
The goal is for work to continue seamlessly after condensation - as if it never happened.

Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Identify the key threads of the conversation and their current status.
2. Plan how to structure the summary for maximum information density.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture the primary user's requests and intents.
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include only the most critical code snippets (changed lines, key function signatures) — never entire files.
4. Errors and fixes: List key errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. User messages: List key user messages that are not tool results and changed intent or provided important feedback.
7. Key tool outputs: Summarize important tool results (file contents, command outputs, search results) that revealed critical information.
8. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that were explicitly assigned and are NOT currently in progress. If no pending tasks, just write 'None'.
9. Current Work: Describe in detail what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, including partial progress and where exactly you left off. If no further work exists (e.g. task completed), just write 'None'.
10. Optional Next Step: Describe the single next action to take. If no further work is needed, just write 'None'.

If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]
</analysis>

<summary>
1. Primary Request and Intent:
  [Detailed description]

2. Key Technical Concepts:
  - [Concept 1]
  - [Concept 2]

3. Files and Code Sections:
  - [File Name 1]
    - [Short summary of why this file is important]
    - [Short summary of the changes made to this file, if any]
    - [Important Code Snippet]
  - [File Name 2]
    - [Important Code Snippet]

4. Errors and fixes:
  - [Key error 1]:
  	- [How you fixed the error]
  	- [User's feedback on the error if any]
  - [Key Error 2]:
		- [...]

5. Problem Solving:
  [Short description of solved problems and ongoing troubleshooting]

6. User messages:
	- [Detailed non tool use user message]
	- [...]

7. Key tool outputs:
	- [File read revealing unexpected API]
	- [...]

8. Pending Tasks:
	- [Task 1]
	- [Task 2]
	- [...]

9. Current Work:
	[Precise description of current work]

10. Optional Next Step:
	[Optional Next step to take]

Please provide your summary based on the conversation so far, following this structure and ensuring precision and thoroughness in your response.

Note: Any <command> blocks from the original task will be automatically appended to your summary wrapped in <system-reminder> tags. You do not need to include them in your summary text.
